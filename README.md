# Flight APP 


### INSTRUCTION
-As a user, I wanted to view the list of flights scheduled for each day as well as a page to
view all orders with their associated flights. Any orders that are not assigned a flight should
be displayed without flight details.
-As a user, I want the ability to drill down to view the orders on each individual flight via a button on
the flight schedule screen.
